<b>Que.2. How do I do the Ranthambore Safari?</b>
<p style="color:blue">The amount of Rs 133 That you have Paid for the safari is just the Tourist Entry Fees that you have paid, After reaching there you have to pay Vehicle entry fee ( around 150 rs), then TRDF (around 20 rs), Vehicle Rent(around 450 to 500 rs) and Guide Fees(around 150 rs) total it costs around 775 to 800, and when you reach the window it is not sure that you get the seat or not because there is a lot of rush and it takes time.</p>
